# Bank-of-England
I was a key member of a remote, cross-functional group working on a bespoke project for the Bank of England. I delivered actionable insights across two presentations to the data science team and received positve feedback on our recommendations and depth of analysis.

### **Project Brief:**
Part of the job of the Bank of England is to provide reassurance and stability to financial markets. One way this is achieved is through representatives of the Bank delivering speeches at various public events. As an organisation, the Bank of England is interested in how the trends in these speeches correlate with observed events and economic indicators, as well as how the sentiment of these speeches can be used to
predict market behaviour. This analysis will inform our understanding of the impact of the Bank’s communications on the economy, as well as the predictive power of using this data set.

### **Business Problem:** 
"Does speech sentiment effectively limit shock?"

#### Project goals:
1. Evaluating potential relationships between speech sentiment and the economy.
2. Determining the effectiveness of the Bank’s communications in mitigating the impact of crises.

#### **Insights and Recommendations:**
The following image shows negative as the prevailing sentiment despite it being on a downward trajectory from a 2009 peak

The following two images of a dashboard we created show the different in sentiment 'tone' from governor to non-governor (top 4 speakers by speech count)
We found a more consisentent 'tone' for governors indicating possibly the nature of how speeches are framed for the respective roles

This image shows one of our insights around the deliberate use of uncertain sentiment. The first time stamp is Northern Rock requesting emergency funds. The uncertain sentiment steeply reduces. But we posit that the sentiment gradually builds back up as an attempt to reduce shock from further developments in the crisis. Then Lehman Brothers collapses sending the sentiment back a low level indicating a 'certainty' to the situation.
